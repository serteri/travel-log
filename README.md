## R1: Description of your website, including purpose, functionality/features, target audience, tech stack. 

Welcome to Serter and Duncan’s Travelog.

**Purpose**

Our Travelog app is a dynamic platform designed to bring travelers and explorers together by allowing them to share their travel experiences. Its core purpose is to create a community of passionate travelers and to build a comprehensive database of travel experiences. Our app will give them a platform to share their experiences, whether users prefer to share stunning photographs or write short narratives that detail the unique local heritage, and recommend places to visit or activities that others might like to try.

Simultaneously our Travelog serves as a helpful resource for individuals planning their next adventure. Users can browse the experiences of others to research potential travel destinations, and will be able to gain first-hand insights e.g. to get an idea of costs of travel. The app will facilitate easy browsing of these posts, allowing users to explore locations based on various categories such as geographical region, activities, local attractions, and more. In this way, Travelog not only fosters a shared community of travel enthusiasts but also provides an invaluable tool for planning travel, acting as a bridge between the past experiences of others and the future journeys of its users.

The purpose of the Wanderlust app is to inspire, inform, and connect travelers from around the world.

**Functionality/Features**

The app will have a range of features allowing users to:
- Create accounts
- Share photos
- Travel Experience Browse: Explore a vast collection of travel experiences shared by fellow travelers. Read captivating narratives, view stunning photographs, and gain valuable insights about various destinations worldwide.
- Travel Experience Creation: Write posts detailing their travel that might include the cost of travel, local history, recommendations of places to visit.
- Edit/delete those posts
- Browse other user’s posts
- Comment on other’s user’s posts e.g. asking a question or just letting the author know you thought their post was cool.

**Target Audience**

- Anyone planning a trip and seeking first-hand, authentic travel advice and recommendations would find value in our app. As such our target audience for the Travelog app encompasses a wide range of travel enthusiasts. From seasoned globetrotters eager to share their off-the-beaten-path experiences, to amateur explorers seeking inspiration for their first journey, or  casual travelers looking for unique, local experiences instead of mainstream tourist destinations. In time we also see great potential in attracting travel bloggers and photographers, for whom the platform could serve as an exciting outlet to share their stories and images, (though we recognise this is a congested space!)
Travel Enthusiasts: Individuals who have a deep passion for travel and are always seeking new adventures and experiences. They are eager to explore new destinations, immerse themselves in different cultures, and continuously expand their travel horizons.

- Aspiring Adventurers: Individuals who may be new to travel or have limited experience but have a strong desire to embark on exciting journeys. They are looking for inspiration, guidance, and resources to plan and execute their travel dreams.

- Community Seekers: People who enjoy being part of a vibrant community of fellow travelers. They are interested in connecting with like-minded individuals, exchanging travel tips, seeking advice, and engaging in conversations about their shared passion for exploration.

- Responsible Travel Advocates: Travelers who prioritize responsible and sustainable tourism practices. They are conscious of their impact on the environment and local communities and seek resources and information to make ethical choices during their travels.

- Trip Planners: Individuals who appreciate having a comprehensive platform for gathering information, evaluating destinations, and planning their trips effectively. They rely on features like cost assessments, local insights, must-visit recommendations, and transportation options to create personalized itineraries.

- Photography Enthusiasts: Travelers who love capturing and sharing their travel experiences through photography. They value features that allow them to showcase their images and visually communicate the beauty and essence of the destinations they visit.

- Cultural Explorers: People who have a deep interest in learning about different cultures, traditions, and local heritages. They seek travel experiences that provide insights into the history, art, cuisine, and lifestyle of the places they visit.
**Tech Stack**

Serter and I will use the MERN stack to create our Travelog app. MERN comprises MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js -  four powerful, open-source components that provide a complete end-to-end framework for developers.

Our decision to use the MERN stack was not only guided by it being a central part of our bootcamp curriculum, but also by the significant advantages it offers. Being a full JavaScript stack, MERN facilitates seamless development across both client and server sides, which should assist us achieve improved efficiency and consistency in our application. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, supports flexible and scalable data management. Express.js streamlines server-side coding, and Node.js provides a robust environment for server-side JavaScript execution, which should mean our app is both fast and scalable. Furthermore, React.js, known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering which will  allow us to create a user-friendly, efficient interface that helps users enjoy a positive user experience.

Beyond the tech advantages though, as budding developers, we found the MERN stack to be particularly approachable. Its open-source nature and the strong backing from a vast community offer an array of benefits, including regular updates, a rich selection of libraries and tools, comprehensive documentation, and readily available support. We will likely draw on all of these resources as we build the app and they will hopefully expedite our development process and allow us to produce an effective app in the timeframe available.
